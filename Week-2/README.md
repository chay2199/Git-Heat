# Problem 2 - The Episode

Abdul loves watching TV shows, and was really excited to see the latest episode of Westworld available for download ! (Let's just say he has a special arrangement in place with HBO ðŸ˜›) His happiness was short lived, however, when he realized that he had no space left to download the episode. So, he needs to free some space, and needs your help in figuring out how to do that. Create an interactive disk space analyzer to help him find out what's taking up all his disk space.

## Basic Requirements

**Input** : A directory.

**Output** : A visualization of the distribution of disk space within that directory. There should be a way to navigate into children and parent directories, resulting in a similar analysis being shown for that directory. The visualization type and mode of interaction is up to you.

## Next Steps

Once you are done with your program, make it better - Add features such as distribution by type, sorting capabilities, deletion support, support for different platforms and, if you think it is good enough, package it for easy execution and release it !

## Resources

You'll need the operating system module for your language: See [os for python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) or [nio for java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileio.html). You might also need a plotting library if you want to display the analysis graphically. See [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) or [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) for python or [JFreeChart for java](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/)

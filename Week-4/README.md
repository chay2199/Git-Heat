# Problem 4 - The Video

Harsh likes watching *videos*, and usually gets them from DC. However, there are times when he *really* needs these videos, but DC doesn't cut it due to failure or long queues (these videos he likes tend to be big in size). And he doesn't want to go all the way to the uploader's room (yeah, he's lazy). Help him by making a file transfer utility that works on the local network.

## Basic Requirements

A program that can send and receive large files over a local network.

## Next Steps

Make it more secure (by implementing encryption) and functional (create a gui, add support for multiple files & folders, multiple receivers and parallel transfers , show stats).

## Resources

You can use the socket library for the language of your choice ([Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/socket-programming), [Python](https://pymotw.com/3/socket/index.html), [C++](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/sockets_server_client.php), [JS](https://socket.io/docs/))
